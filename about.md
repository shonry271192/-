### About Me

Hello there, call me kevy. I know English, മലയാളം (Malayalam), हिंदी (Hindi) and a smattering of தமிழ் (Tamil). I am an avid fan of Linux and open source enthusiast. I have been enjoying Linux for the past one decade. Back in 2007, I stumbled upon an article about Ubuntu live CD. I didn't know it at the time but that moment changed my life. I know that statements like that belong on those exaggerators but it is actually true. Within 24 hours of reading the article I had turned my own desktop into Ubuntu one -- a platform where I have explored everything about Linux ever since. I have learned so much from the experience of that try that I have since tried many other Linux distributions.

This blog is not more than a typical Linux blog but here you can find some daily needs of Linux which I have tried and found useful. I use [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com) as well as [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org) on my laptop and since [Debian](https://debian.org) is a stable distribution, I installed it on my experimental server.

Apart from Linux, I watch Sherlock Homes BBC series as well as Christopher Nolan movies and read non-fiction. [I am not finished.](/kevydotvinu.github.io/more)
